MOBILE_PROXY = False  # True - mobile proxy / False - regular proxy
ROTATE_IP = False  # Setup for mobile proxy only
CHECK_GWEI = False
MAX_GWEI = 20
SLIPPAGE = 0.03

MONAD_TESTNET_RPC = 'https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz'
TG_BOT_TOKEN = ''
TG_USER_ID = None
CAPSOLVER_API = ''
```

#### Execution Controls

-  `PAUSE_BETWEEN_WALLETS` - Delay between processing wallets.

-  `PAUSE_BETWEEN_MODULES` - Delay between module execution.

-  `RETRIES` - Number of retry attempts.

-  `PAUSE_BETWEEN_RETRIES` - Delay before retrying failed actions.

#### Modules

-  `OKX_WITHDRAW + GAZ_ZIP_TO_MON` - Buy MON for ETH from selected networks.

-  `RANDOM_SWAPS` - Swap MON into random tokens based on RandomSwapsSettings.

-  `SWAP_ALL_TO_MON` - Convert all tokens to MON.

-  `MINTS` - Automate NFT minting.

-  `DEPLOY_CONTRACT` - Deploy smart contracts if needed.

#### Additional Settings

-  `Proxy Support` - Mobile and regular proxy options (MOBILE_PROXY, ROTATE_IP).

-  `Gwei Control` - Check gas fees before executing transactions (CHECK_GWEI, MAX_GWEI).

-  `Liquidity & Staking` - Support for deposits and withdrawals (ARR_IO_DEPOSIT, APR_IO_WITHDRAW).

#### Staking & Liquidity
