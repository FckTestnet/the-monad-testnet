## Monad Testnet Tools

### Description
Welcome to Monad Testnet Tools, a suite of automated scripts designed to interact with the Monad testnet. This software provides various modules to facilitate transactions, token swaps, and NFT minting, bridging, liquidity management, and contract deployments. all with configurable settings to suit your needs.

### Setup Instructions:
-  Python `3.7 or higher` (recommended 3.9 or 3.10 due to asyncio usage).

-  pip (Python package installer)

### Features

-  Proxy Support: Supports both mobile and regular proxies.

-  GWEI Management: Allows setting a maximum GWEI limit for transactions.

-  Wallet Handling: Shuffle wallets and configure pauses between operations.

-  Token Swaps: Supports BEAN Exchange and Bebop Swap.

-  Liquidity Management: Deposit and withdraw from https://stake.apr.io/.

-  Minting NFTs & Domains: Supports various NFT projects.

-  Bridging: Bridge assets from ARB/OP to Sepolia.

-  OKX Withdrawal: Configurable withdrawal settings from OKX exchange.

-  Gas Refueling: Refill gas from multiple chains.

### Configuration
All settings are in config.py. Key options include:

#### General Settings
```yaml
MOBILE_PROXY = False  # True - mobile proxy / False - regular proxy
ROTATE_IP = False  # Setup for mobile proxy only
CHECK_GWEI = False
MAX_GWEI = 20
SLIPPAGE = 0.03

MONAD_TESTNET_RPC = 'https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz'
TG_BOT_TOKEN = ''
TG_USER_ID = None
CAPSOLVER_API = ''
```

#### Wallet Handling
```yaml
SHUFFLE_WALLETS = False
PAUSE_BETWEEN_WALLETS = [10, 25]
PAUSE_BETWEEN_MODULES = [10, 20]
PAUSE_BETWEEN_CYCLES = [3600, 3600]
RETRIES = 3
PAUSE_BETWEEN_RETRIES = 15
```

#### Token Swap Settings
```yaml
class BEANSwapSettings:
    from_token = ['MON']  # Supported: MON, USDC
    to_token = ['USDC']
    amount = 0.1
    use_percentage = True
    swap_percentage = [0.2, 0.3]
    swap_all_balance = False

class BebopSwapSettings:
    from_token = ['USDC']
    to_token = ['MON']
    amount = 0.1
    use_percentage = False
    swap_percentage = [0.1, 0.1]
    swap_all_balance = True
```

#### Bridging Settings
```yaml
class TestnetBridgeConfig:
    from_chain = 'OP'
    to_chain = 'SEPOLIA'
    amount = 0.1
    use_percentage = True
    bridge_percentage = [0.1, 0.2]
    min_mon_balance = 10
```

#### Execution Controls

-  `PAUSE_BETWEEN_WALLETS` - Delay between processing wallets.

-  `PAUSE_BETWEEN_MODULES` - Delay between module execution.

-  `RETRIES` - Number of retry attempts.

-  `PAUSE_BETWEEN_RETRIES` - Delay before retrying failed actions.

#### Modules

-  `OKX_WITHDRAW + GAZ_ZIP_TO_MON` - Buy MON for ETH from selected networks.

-  `RANDOM_SWAPS` - Swap MON into random tokens based on RandomSwapsSettings.

-  `SWAP_ALL_TO_MON` - Convert all tokens to MON.

-  `MINTS` - Automate NFT minting.

-  `DEPLOY_CONTRACT` - Deploy smart contracts if needed.

#### Additional Settings

-  `Proxy Support` - Mobile and regular proxy options (MOBILE_PROXY, ROTATE_IP).

-  `Gwei Control` - Check gas fees before executing transactions (CHECK_GWEI, MAX_GWEI).

-  `Liquidity & Staking` - Support for deposits and withdrawals (ARR_IO_DEPOSIT, APR_IO_WITHDRAW).

#### Staking & Liquidity

- Kitsu, Apriori, Magma Staking - Stake, unstake, and claim MON rewards with configurable cycles.

-  Bebop & Izumi Wrap/Unwrap - Convert MON to WMON and vice
